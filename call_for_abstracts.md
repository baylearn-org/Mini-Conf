### About BayLearn
The BayLearn Symposium is an annual gathering of machine learning researchers and scientists from the San Francisco Bay Area. While BayLearn promotes community building and technical discussions between local researchers from academic and industrial institutions, it also welcomes visitors. This one-day event combines invited talks, contributed talks, and posters, to foster exchange of ideas.

Meet with fellow Bay Area machine learning researchers and scientists during the symposium that will be held on Thursday, October 10th, 2024

Feel free to circulate this invitation to your colleagues and relevant contacts.
