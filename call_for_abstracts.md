About BayLearn:
The BayLearn Symposium is an annual gathering of machine learning researchers and scientists from the San Francisco Bay Area. While BayLearn promotes community building and technical discussions between local researchers from academic and industrial institutions, it also welcomes visitors. This one-day event combines invited talks, contributed talks, and posters, to foster exchange of ideas.
