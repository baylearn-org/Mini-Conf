However, reinforcement learning is classically seen as an active learning framework, where new data must be collected during the learning process. This poses a serious constraint on the practical real-world application of reinforcement learning algorithms: many real-world domains where we wish to apply automated decision making via RL make it expensive, dangerous, or otherwise impractical to actively collect data during the training process. Offline reinforcement learning methods offer an alternative approach: instead of actively collecting data during learning, such methods aim to learn the best possible policy out of an existing previously collected dataset. Analogously to the widely used supervised methods, such algorithms can in principle use large datasets that are collected once, and then reused to learn policies for a variety of tasks. However, in contrast to supervised learning methods, offline RL makes few assumptions on this data, using it to interpret how the world works, rather than how to solve the task at hand. Unfortunately, offline RL introduces a range of new technical challenges that are not present in standard online RL settings, revolving around the challenges of distributional shift between the learned policy and the (unknown) behavior policy that collected the data. In brief, offline RL is hard because we must learn a policy that behaves differently (and better) than the policy that collected the data, but it is difficult to evaluate this policy, since we do not have any access to what this new policy would have experienced if it were executed in the real world. In this talk, I will discuss recent advances that make offline RL a practical tool for real-world problems, the theoretical foundations of offline RL methods, as well as several recent applications that illustrate the applicability of these methods to real-world tasks.","Sergey Levine received a BS and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2009, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2014.

However, in most scenarios this is not a standard supervised learning framework. AI4science often requires zero-shot generalization to entirely new scenarios not seen during training. For instance, drug discovery requires predicting properties of new molecules that can vastly differ from training data, and AI-based PDE solvers require solving any instance of the PDE family. Such zero-shot generalization requires infusing domain knowledge and structure. I will present recent success stories in using AI to obtain 1000x speedups in solving PDEs and quantum chemistry calculations.","Anima Anandkumar is a Bren Professor at Caltech and Director of ML Research at NVIDIA.
