In this talk, I will describe recent Waymo research on performant ML models and architectures that help us handle the variety and complexity of the real world driving environment, and I will outline key remaining research challenges in our domain.","Drago joined Waymo in 2018 to lead the Research team, which focuses on developing the state of the art in autonomous driving using machine learning and has contributed to many of the systems powering the company’s Waymo One service. Drago spent eight years at Google; first working on 3D vision and pose estimation for StreetView, and later leading a research team which developed computer vision systems for annotating Google Photos. The team also invented popular methods such as the Inception neural network architecture and the SSD detector, which helped win the Imagenet 2014 Classification and Detection challenges. Before Waymo, Drago led the 3D Perception team at Zoox.","session","https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragomiranguelov/","video_url"

Learn you.com's approach to tackling key challenges: inaccuracies, outdated information, and lack of transparency. Socher will review the technical pillars, including real-time web access, enhanced citation mechanisms, and a model-agnostic compound AI platform. Discover how these solutions improve LLM performance on complex tasks, build user trust, and pave the way for broader AI adoption. Gain insights into evaluating LLM effectiveness, deploying these practices into your own LLM projects, and the future of trustworthy AI. Q&A follows.","Richard Socher is the founder and CEO of you.com. Richard previously served as the Chief Scientist and EVP at Salesforce. Before that, Richard was the CEO/CTO of AI startup MetaMind, acquired by Salesforce in 2016. Richard received his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford. He is widely recognized as having brought neural networks into the field of natural language processing, inventing the most widely used word vectors, contextual vectors and prompt engineering. He has over 190,000 citations and served as an adjunct professor in the computer science department at Stanford.","session","https://www.socher.org/","video_url"
