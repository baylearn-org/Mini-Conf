Machine learning models, while powerful, can produce unpredictable results. This uncertainty becomes even more pronounced in areas where verification is challenging, such as in machine translation or probabilistic genotyping. Providing users with guidance on when to rely on a system is challenging because models can create a wide range of outputs (e.g. text), error boundaries are highly stochastic, and automated explanations themselves may be incorrect. In this talk, I will discuss approaches to improving the reliability of ML-based systems by designing actionable strategies for a user to gauge reliability and recover from potential errors. At a higher level, I will share perspectives from the field of HCI on designing reliable AI systems by centering user needs and context of use.","Niloufar Salehi is an assistant professor in the School of Information at UC, Berkeley and faculty member of Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). She studies human-computer interaction, with her research spanning education to healthcare to restorative justice. Her research interests are in social computing, human-centered AI, and more broadly, human-computer interaction (HCI). Her work has been published and received awards in premier venues including ACM CHI and CSCW and has been covered in Venture Beat, Wired, and the Guardian. She is a W. T. Grant Foundation scholar. She received her PhD in computer science from Stanford University in 2018.","session",https://niloufar.org/

They have played a vital role in both the direction and velocity of how the technology develops.  Traditionally, benchmarks have focused on particular tasks (e.g., object recognition or question answering).  But with the rise of foundation models such as GPT-4, the scope of benchmarking has vastly expanded given their general-purpose nature.  In this talk, we describe some of our efforts to benchmark foundation models, including Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM), interactive and multimodal extensions, and evaluation of generative search engines such as Bing Chat.  Benchmarking shines a spotlight on the capabilities and limitations of foundation models, serving as a faithful guide for researchers, application developers, and policymakers."," Percy Liang is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University (B.S. from MIT, 2004; Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, 2011) and the director of the Center for Research on Foundation Models and a co-founder of Together AI. His research spans many topics in machine learning and natural language processing, including robustness, interpretability, semantics, and reasoning. He is also a strong proponent of reproducibility through the creation of CodaLab Worksheets. His awards include the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2019), IJCAI Computers and Thought Award (2016), an NSF CAREER Award (2016), a Sloan Research Fellowship (2015), a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (2014), and multiple paper awards at ACL, EMNLP, ICML, and COLT.","session","https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/"
3,"static/images/speakers/chrismre_headshot_lowres.jpg","Associate Professor","Prof. Christopher Re","Department of Computer Science at Stanford University",Some Building Blocks for Foundation Model Systems,"This talk will first describe how I fell in love with foundation models. The short version is that foundation models radically improved data systems that I had been trying to build for almost a decade. Then, I'll talk about our work making foundation models more efficient, e.g., Flash Attention. I'll then describe work on some new asymptotically more efficient architectures--so-called subquadratic models--including S4, Hyena, and Monarch Mixer. I'll also try to describe our best understanding of the current limits of the exciting approaches in this area. Two themes in the talk will be understanding the role of inductive bias in AI models and understanding how robust or narrow our recipe to get amazing AI is. ","Christopher (Chris) Re is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. He is in the Stanford AI Lab and is affiliated with the Machine Learning Group and the Center for Research on Foundation Models.  His recent work is to understand how software and hardware systems will change because of machine learning along with a continuing, petulant drive to work on math problems. Research from his group has been incorporated into scientific and humanitarian efforts, such as the fight against human trafficking, along with products from technology and companies including Apple, Google, YouTube, and more. He has also cofounded companies, including Snorkel, SambaNova, and Together, and a venture firm, called Factory.

His family still brags that he received the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, but his closest friends are confident that it was a mistake. His research contributions have spanned database theory, database systems, and machine learning, and his work has won best paper at a premier venue in each area, respectively, at PODS 2012, SIGMOD 2014, and ICML 2016. Due to great collaborators, he received the NeurIPS 2020 test-of-time award and the PODS 2022 test-of-time award. Due to great students, he received best paper at MIDL 2022, best paper runner up at ICLR22 and ICML22, and best student-paper runner up at UAI22.","session","https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/"
