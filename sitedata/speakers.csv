2,static/images/speakers/headshot_salehi.jpg,"Assistant professor","Prof. Niloufar Salehi","School of Information at UC, Berkeley",Designing Reliable Human-AI Interactions,"How can users trust an AI system that fails in unpredictable ways? Machine learning models, while powerful, can produce unpredictable results. This uncertainty becomes even more pronounced in areas where verification is challenging, such as in machine translation or probabilistic genotyping. Providing users with guidance on when to rely on a system is challenging because models can create a wide range of outputs (e.g. text), error boundaries are highly stochastic, and automated explanations themselves may be incorrect. In this talk, I will discuss approaches to improving the reliability of ML-based systems by designing actionable strategies for a user to gauge reliability and recover from potential errors. At a higher level, I will share perspectives from the field of HCI on designing reliable AI systems by centering user needs and context of use.","Niloufar Salehi is an assistant professor in the School of Information at UC, Berkeley and faculty member of Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). She studies human-computer interaction, with her research spanning education to healthcare to restorative justice. Her research interests are in social computing, human-centered AI, and more broadly, human-computer interaction (HCI). Her work has been published and received awards in premier venues including ACM CHI and CSCW and has been covered in Venture Beat, Wired, and the Guardian. She is a W. T. Grant Foundation scholar. She received her PhD in computer science from Stanford University in 2018.","session",homepage
